## Adding the go.sum file
I wasn't sure if I should push the `go.sum` file in my repo, but after some research I found that in Golan FAQ. It says 
<blockquote>
  Should I commit my 'go.sum' file as well as my 'go.mod' file?
  Typically your module's go.sum file should be committed along with your go.mod file.

  go.sum contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions.
  If someone clones your repository and downloads your dependencies using the go command, they will receive an error if there is any mismatch between their downloaded copies of your dependencies and the corresponding entries in your go.sum.
  In addition, go mod verify checks that the on-disk cached copies of module downloads still match the entries in go.sum.
  Note that go.sum is not a lock file as used in some alternative dependency management systems. (go.mod provides enough information for reproducible builds).
  See very brief rationale here from Filippo Valsorda on why you should check in your go.sum. See the "Module downloading and verification" section of the tip documentation for more details. See possible future extensions being discussed for example in #24117 and #25530.
